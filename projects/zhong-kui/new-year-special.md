"Often, the so-called 'tranquility of the soul' is merely a misunderstanding—perhaps just an unconscious gratitude for a smooth digestion."

### 🏮 Insights from Feng Ji

On the eve of the Year of the Horse, Feng Ji released this "eerie yet heartwarming" video for **Black Myth: Zhong Kui**. Quoting Nietzsche's **Twilight of the Idols**, he expressed a primal understanding of life: **Happiness often stems from the most stable source—"Eating."**

> The first real-time footage of **Black Myth: Zhong Kui** has arrived out of the blue.
> I wonder, after watching this, will you break into a knowing smile? Be left in utter confusion? Or immediately start analyzing a pile of hidden metaphors, plot directions, or new technical features? 
> 
> Hey, don't be so serious. Chill out.
> 
> If this New Year short film leaves you with a sense of surprise mixed with a hint of the uncanny, and warmth tinged with the grotesque, I’ll be quite satisfied.
> 
> I know, I know—no controls, no combat, no gameplay, and no Zhong Kui. Because... well, we haven't made them yet (just kidding).
> 
> We spend every day wielding swords and spears. With the New Year approaching, why not sit down and enjoy a bowl of hot soup? Watch out, it’s hot~
> 
> In **Twilight of the Idols**, Nietzsche wrote something a bit mouthful:
> "Often, the so-called 'tranquility of the soul' is merely a misunderstanding—perhaps just an unconscious gratitude for a smooth digestion."
> 
> A friend of mine once expressed a similar sentiment, saying that after reaching a certain age, he realized that only eating brings the most frequent and stable sense of happiness. As I grow older, I find myself agreeing more and more.
> 
> In the coming Year of the Horse, I wish you all to always enjoy eating, and occasionally enjoy cooking; to always have a good appetite, and ideally, someone pleasant to share your meals with.
> 
> Life is more than just games; there are many, many more delicious things to enjoy.
