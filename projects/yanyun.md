## 2. Core Philosophy: No Sects, Total Freedom
*Where Winds Meet* redefines the boundaries of open-world martial arts.
* **No Sect Restrictions**: Players are not bound to a single school. You can learn diverse techniques like Acupuncture and Tai Chi by "observing" others or challenging masters.
* **Environmental Interaction**: Elements like flowing water, falling leaves, and even animal behaviors can inspire your martial arts moves.
* **Oriental Wonders**: Beyond hard-hitting combat, the game integrates traditional cultural elements such as astrology and meridian systems.
