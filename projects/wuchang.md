## 1. Lore: Ancient Shu & Featherization
The story takes place during the turbulent final years of the Ming Dynasty in the land of Bashu. Beyond the historical chaos lies the "Featherization" plague—a grotesque mutation linked to the mysterious Sanxingdui civilization that transforms people into eldritch horrors instead of immortals.
