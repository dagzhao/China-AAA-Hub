### ☯️ Yin & Yang (阴阳): The Art of Counter-flow
In the West, we see Good vs. Evil. In Taoism, we see **Balance**. 
* **The Mechanic:** Yin represents the "Soft" (dodging, parrying, stillness), while Yang represents the "Hard" (striking, fire, movement).
* **Gameplay Tip:** When a Boss unleashes a massive "Yang" attack, a smart player uses "Yin" techniques—deflecting the force instead of clashing head-on. It’s the philosophy of "Using softness to overcome hardness" (以柔克刚).

### ⚡ The Five Elements (五行): More than just "Fire & Ice"
The *Wu Xing* system is a sophisticated cycle of "Generation" and "Overcoming."

| Element | Interaction | Game Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metal (金)** | Cuts Wood | Sharpness & Critical DMG |
| **Wood (木)** | Roots Earth | Healing & Crowd Control |
| **Water (水)** | Quenches Fire | Freezing & Fluid Movement |
| **Fire (火)** | Melts Metal | Burn DoT & Explosive Power |
| **Earth (土)** | Dams Water | Defense & Heavy Stance |

### 📜 Talismans & Seals (符印): Divine Arrest Warrants
Why do heroes throw "pieces of paper" at gods? 
* **The Secret:** These are not just scrolls; they are **Celestial Edicts**. In Taoism, the practitioner acts as a cosmic judge. 
* **In-Game:** A Talisman is essentially a "Software Patch" for reality—it commands the spirits to freeze, burn, or vanish by the authority of the higher heavens.
